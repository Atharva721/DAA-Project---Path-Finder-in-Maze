🧭 Path Finder in Maze

This project is a Maze Pathfinding Simulation developed using Python.
It visualizes how a pathfinding algorithm navigates from the start point to the goal within a maze, using a simple Tkinter-based user interface.

🧩 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

Maze representation using 2D matrices

Pathfinding algorithm implementation (using backtracking)

Visualization of the maze and path using Tkinter UI

It’s a beginner-friendly project designed to understand basic Python logic, conditional statements, and GUI programming concepts.

🚀 Features

🧱 Maze Design: Custom maze layout using 2D matrices

🧭 Pathfinding Algorithm: Finds and highlights the path from start to goal

🖥️ User Interface: Simple and interactive UI built with Tkinter

⚙️ How to Run the Project
🪄 Step 1: Install Python

Make sure Python 3.x or above is installed on your system.
Check installation by running:

python --version

▶️ Step 2: Run the Script

Navigate to the project directory and execute:

python pathfinder.py

🎯 Step 3: Enjoy the Simulation

The Tkinter window will display the maze and visualize the pathfinding process step by step.

🖼️ Example Output

A sample window shows the maze where the algorithm finds the shortest path and visually marks it using color highlights.
