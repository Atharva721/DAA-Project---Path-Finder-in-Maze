Path Finder in Maze

This project is a Maze Pathfinding Simulation developed using Python.
It visualizes how a pathfinding algorithm works to navigate from the start point to the goal within a maze, using a simple Tkinter-based user interface.

Project Overview

The project demonstrates:

Maze representation using matrices

Pathfinding algorithm implementation

Visualization of the maze and path using Tkinter UI

It’s a beginner-friendly project to understand basic Python logic, conditional statements, and GUI programming concepts.

Features

Maze Design: Custom maze layout using 2D matrices

Pathfinding Algorithm: Finds and highlights the path from start to goal

User Interface: Simple and interactive UI built with Tkinter

How to Run the Project

Install Python (3.x or above)
Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can check by running:

python --version


Run the script
Navigate to the project directory and execute:

python pathfinder.py


Enjoy the simulation!
The Tkinter window will display the maze and visualize the pathfinding process.

Example Output

A sample window shows the maze where the algorithm finds the shortest path and visually marks it.

Concepts Used

Lists and Matrices in Python

Conditional and Loop Statements

Tkinter GUI Components

Pathfinding Algorithm (e.g., DFS / BFS / Backtracking)
